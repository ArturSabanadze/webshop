## Installation and Setup (with XAMPP as APACHE and MYSQL server)

### Prerequisites

- XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)
- Windows operating system (for setup.bat automation)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:** (If you have the Project zip folder skip to step 2)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArturSabanadze/webshop.git
   cd webshop
   ```

2. **Install XAMPP:** (If already installed skip to 3)

   - Download and install XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/
   - Install to default location: `C:\xampp` **<--- (Important for setup.bat workflow)**

3. **Configure MySQL:**

   - Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP Control Panel
   - Ensure MySQL has no password (default), or update credentials in:
     - `Backend/config/.env`
     - `setup.bat`

4. **Automated Setup:**

   - Run `setup.bat` to:
     - Copy project files to XAMPP htdocs
     - Create database schema
     - Import test data
     - Configure environment

5. **Access the Application:**

   - Frontend: `http://localhost/Die_Fantastische_4/Frontend/public/index.php`
   - User Credentials: username: user | password: user1

   - Admin Dashboard: `http://localhost/Die_Fantastische_4/Frontend/public/AdminDashboard/private/admin_dashboard.php`
   - Admin Credentials: username: admin | password: admin1

### Manual Database Setup (Alternative)

If automated setup doesn't work:

1. Connect to MySQL:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root
   ```

2. Execute SQL scripts:
   ```sql
   source Initializer/db_schema.sql;
   source Initializer/dummy_data.sql;
   ```

# Webshop - Seminar Management System

A comprehensive web-based platform for managing and booking seminars/courses online. This project implements a full-featured webshop specifically designed for educational seminars with user authentication, admin dashboard, and enrollment management.

## Project Overview

This webshop is a seminar management system that enables users to browse available courses, register for seminars, and manage their enrollments. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for customers and a powerful admin dashboard for managing seminars, dates, and participants.

## Architecture

The project follows a modern three-tier architecture:

- **Frontend**: PHP-based user interface with responsive design
- **Backend**: RESTful API handlers for business logic and database operations
- **Database**: MySQL database with normalized schema using PDO for secure data access
- **Admin Dashboard**: Protected administrative interface for system management

## Key Features

- **Location**: `Frontend/src/Includes/main.php`
- Grid view of all available seminars/courses
- Fetches product data from the database and renders in an organized card layout
- Displays product images, descriptions, prices, and availability

### 2. **Advanced Search & Filtering**

- **Location**: `Frontend/src/Includes/shop.php`, `Frontend/src/Functions/product_card_loader.php`

- Browse available seminar dates and times
- View capacity and availability information
- Real-time enrollment processing via AJAX
- Enrollment confirmation and tracking

### 5. **User Panel**
